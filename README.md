# MooPlayGame

In this project, I refactored existing code for the game "Moo", similar to Mastermind, where I identified and addressed code smells to improve the code quality and testability. 
I implemented principles for proper naming, method structuring, commenting, class usage, error handling, and created clean tests, while considering the use of appropriate design patterns. 
Additionally, I separated the program's different layers – user interface, program logic, and statistics collection
– using Dependency Injection to assemble them, and wrote tests for the program logic, employing Mock-Objects to manage IO and simulate random number generation.
